# exploring-spaCy
First foray into NLP with spaCy using the `en_core_web_md` language model. `semantics.py` involves testing with vectors and short text. `watch_next.py` is a system that will tell you what to watch next based on word vector similarity of the description of movies.

## Install
- `pip3 install spacy`\
- `en_core_web_md`
